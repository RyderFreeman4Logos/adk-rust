# Run cargo on the rust-toolchain.toml-pinned toolchain, and refuse otherwise.
#
# `cargo` on PATH is not necessarily rustup-managed: a shadowing cargo (e.g.
# from nix) silently ignores rust-toolchain.toml, so quality gates would run
# on the wrong compiler and fail on lints the pinned toolchain never emits.
# This wrapper is fail-closed: it resolves the pin through rustup when
# available, then verifies the cargo it is about to exec reports exactly the
# pinned version. Anything else exits non-zero without running the gate.
#
# Usage: scripts/cargo-pinned.sh <cargo args...>
#
# This prepends the toolchain's bin dir rather than `rustup run`: cargo
# resolves subcommands such as cargo-clippy from PATH, so routing only the
# cargo binary would pair a pinned cargo with a shadowing newer clippy driver.
